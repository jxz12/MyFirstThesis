TODO:

- passive vs active voice (can a chapter/section study something? ** no, use 'concerns')
- first section and abstract should emphasise ecobuilder more

EcoBuilder:
- Dan p108: exponential number of zero abundance equilibriums?
   ** change 'cancel out' to 'non-zero solution' don't show extra skin
   ** make sure you mention 2^n
- Figure 3.2
   ** google image search with licence in tools
   ** make sure you emphasise multi-cellular eukaryotes, and clarify mass-specific everywhere
- Samraat p116 topology calculation
   ** add qualifier of 'completely general graph', and mention topological constraints
   ** add this later in the discussion to say why computers cannot do this 
- Samraat p117 'niche axis'
   ** the sentence is just a bit vague, specify difference between 'niche' here and bodymass. explicitly say that there is no real use of this in the game
- redo trophic constraint figure

- drop EcoBuilder hypothesis structure, change to objectives
   ** it is exploratory, treat it as such
  - On that note, should we reframe the Research World objective in terms of comparing to real world food webs?
   ** add to the second objective - do the topologies recreate that of real 
- Dan how to present the recommendations from learning world
   ** p142, use the word significant
   ** move the more informal bits (shining recommendation) to discussion
  - p144 X^2 test?
   ** to see if it follows a distribution
- How to say the problem is too much for computers
   ** lots of topologies
- cite hsi-cheng thesis with et al.?
   ** no need
- p152 back and forth between computer and player?
   ** look at strategies taken by players, and search *around* this space with computer
   ** add new Research World levels based on this back and forth too
   ** explicitly mention that there is clear evidence that learning happened (emphasise the top 3 over the others in the discussion)
   ** emphasise connectance of real webs (ask hsi-cheng for this, or google goldwasser and roughgarden, "sampling foodweb structure")
   ** and can add more of these suggestions as future work
- finish conclusion

send to Dan, Samraat, don't explicitly say send to examiners (protect yourself)
