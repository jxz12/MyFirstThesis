This entire project started back in 2015. Thank you supervisors for sticking with me all this way.

Big thank you goes to Hsi-Cheng for helping me with the ecological side of EcoBuilder. Could not have been possible without you.

And thank you to all the players of EcoBuilder who made the analyses in the last chapter possible.
